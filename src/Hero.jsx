      <p>
        I'm a software engineer based in Lahore, Pakistan and also a university
        student in computer science. I enjoy creating things that <br /> live on the
        internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in
        between. I have been freelancing for a year now while studying at the
        university and I've manage to gain a decent amount of experience and
        valuable knowledge from all different <br /> kinds of fields throughout my
        projects/work.
